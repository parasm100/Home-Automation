Relays

Bolt cannot control AC devices directly. The reason for the same are as follows
Bolt is DC powered device. Thus if there any point of contact between the DC and AC the board will burn.
Bolt is a LOW power device , any high currents generated on the PCB of Bolt will burn the tracks.

To overcome these drawbacks we have to use solid state relay. 
To know more about functioning of Solid state relays AND relays in general please refer to the following links:

Circuit Connections of A relay and Bolt. 
To control a Simple Bulb When A0 is LOW the Bulb will be OFF and COM will be connected to NC. 

When A0 is HIGH the coil will be energized causing the COM pin to connect to NO pin thus completing the circuit and Glowing the Bulb
